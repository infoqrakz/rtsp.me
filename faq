To create a broadcast, you need:

1. Camera supporting RTSP and H.264.

Recommended cameras: Hikvision, Dahua, Line.
You need to know the RTSP link (it can be found on the camera manufacturer's website), 
for example: login - admin, password - pass , ip - 8.8.8.8 , port - 554 or 9784.

Hikvision −
rtsp://admin:pass@8.8.8.8:554 /Streaming/Channels/101 ;
rtsp://admin:pass@8.8.8.8:554 /Streaming/Channels/102 .

Dahua-
rtsp://admin:pass@8.8.8.8:554/cam/realmonitor?channel=1&subtype=0 ;
rtsp://admin:pass@8.8.8.8:554/cam/realmonitor?channel=1&subtype=1 .

line -
rtsp://admin:pass@8.8.8.8: 9784/cameras/0/streaming/main?audio=1 ;
rtsp://admin:pass@8.8.8.8:9784/cameras/0/streaming/sub .


Recommended camera settings:
codec − H.264;
FPS - 25;
GOP (i-frame) - 50 fps (2 sec).

2. Static IP, which you can request from your ISP.

If the IP address is real dynamic, you can use Dynamic Dns services (https://www.noip.com/ , https://account.dyn.com/).

If the IP address is gray, you can install the demo version of the Line video surveillance system and connect a camera to it.

3. Port-mapping.

You need to port-map port 554 or 9784 to your camera's local IP, for this you need to have administrator access to your router settings.

Rule example:

External IP - External port - Internal IP - Internal port - Protocol
ANY 554 192.168.1.100 554 TCP/UDP.

Type in a search engine a query like: “your router name + port mapping”.

If you need to connect multiple cameras, use different external ports.

Rule example:
External IP - External port - Internal IP - Internal port - Protocol
ANY 554 192.168.1.100 554 TCP/UDP
ANY 555 192.168.1.101 554 TCP/UDP.
 
After setting up port-mapping, check if the port is open - https://portscaner.ru/.

4. Once configured, you can place the HTML code on your website
